    "I did the correlation graph using scatter plot in the first place to find the inner correlation between variables. After that, I also draw the heat-map using seaborn packages,also finding the inner correlation between variables. From above, we can find some significant features that can make meaningful contribution to the later analysis. After that, I use scatter plot to find out the correlationship between the features that I selected before which are carat, depth, and table. In next part, I draw the pie chart to show the distribution of data sample that lay in different classes according to their cut and bar chart according to their color. In the end, I combined them together with in one box plot which hue by cut and x-labeled by color. "
